# Release Notes

The Elemental project stack is made of various components such as the `Operator` and `UI` for example.

Each of these components have an independent development lifecycle with its own versioning. Once a new version is ready, meaning it fully integrates with the others components of the Elemental project stack, a release is made.

Here's the different components, their latest version and a link to the respective release notes on GitHub:

:::note Information on docs versioning

The docs versioning is based on `Elemental Operator` instead of `Elemental Linux`. The reason is that, as a user, the component used as an "entrypoint" to the Elemental project stack is the operator and not the Linux OS directly.
